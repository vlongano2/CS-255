# CS-255

The DriverPass project was to make a system that would handle all the things that the client wanted their business to do. The client was the owner of DriverPass who had a company that aimed to improve peoples driving test outcomes at the DMV. They wanted a multifunctional system that would essentially be a self service portal for their customers that could execute all the funtions of the business.

I think I made my diagrams pretty well. I think my explanations of limitations and security could use a bit of work. That said I may revise the business requirements document if I had to.

I interpreted the user needs by adressing what the end goal was, and then working backwords to build the system to accomplish that goal. User needs are essential what make up all the functions of a system. Without them, you would not have a system that is useful to anyone.
 
I design software by breaking it down into requirements and then build it based on those. It is an additive process. In the future I may make more diagrams for myself to use as maps for how I want the software layed out.
